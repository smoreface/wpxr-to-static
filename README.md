# WordPress eXtended RSS to Static Site Generator Conversion

## Overview

Python3 program to convert WordPress XML Export (WPXR) format files to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) Markdown files (with YAML metadata).

The latest version can be downloaded from <https://github.com/danielfdickinson/wpxr-to-static>.

This program is called wpxr-to-static because it is hoped (but not tested) that one could convert to other static generation systems simply by modifying the data models in the configuration files.

## Acknowledgements

Inspired by ["ExitWP for Hugo" by Arjan Wooning](https://github.com/wooni005/exitwp-for-hugo), which was a port of [Thomas Fr√∂ssman's ExitWP tool (for Jekyll)](https://github.com/some-programs/exitwp). wpxr-to-static is not a port of "ExitWP for Hugo", but a completely new program. However, "ExitWP for Hugo" served as an excellent educational guide and testbed for understanding the ElementTree (Python standard library module used to parse the WPXR file) result of parsing the WPXR file as well as the internal tree structure created by parsing the 'config.yaml' file.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8 or 3.9 (lower Python 3.x _may_ work but are untested).
- html5lib
- markdownify
- PyYAML
- toml
- urllib3

## Using

### "Install"

#### Obtain the Program: Option 1 (Archive)

Download a ZIP file containing the Python script from [Github](https://github.com/danielfdickinson/wpxr-to-static/archive/refs/tags/0.2.0-alpha.7.zip) or download a .tar.gz file containing the Python script from [Github](https://github.com/danielfdickinson/wpxr-to-static/archive/refs/tags/0.2.0-alpha.7.tar.gz)

#### Obtain the Program: Option 2 (Git clone)

Clone the source from [WPXR by Daniel F. Dickinson on Github](https://github.com/danielfdickinson/wpxr-to-static)
```
git clone https://github.com/danielfdickinson/wpxr-to-static.git
```

#### Obtain the Dependencies

In the directory resulting from extracting the .zip or the .tar.gz, or from cloning, issue:

```
pip install --user -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure

Before you run the migration script, update the ``config.yaml`` file to specify how and what to migrate from your Wordpress export. 

First, make the files easy to find: 
1. Copy the ``config.yaml`` file included in wpxr-to-static from the extracted .zip or .tar.gz, or cloned directory to a convenient location.
2. If you want to change the 'data model' you can also copy ``hugo_data_model.yaml`` to a location of your choice (not necessarily the same as ``config.yaml``)

Next, update the ``config.yaml`` file. 

As the comments in ``config.yaml`` indicate, the defaults are present in the ``config.yaml`` as commented out entries. Uncomment lines to make the script work, and optionally change some of the configuration settings of interest (see next section). 

#### Some Configuration Settings of Particular Interest
These are configuration settings that you likely want to update in ``config.yaml``.

``data_models``: A configuration file defining the mapping of the WPXR XML tags and contents to an intermediate form used to create a combination of YAML frontmatter and Markdown files for each post or page, and a config.toml for the site.

``wpxr_file``: Sets the location and name of the source WPXR (WordPress Xml) file.

``build_dir``: Where output is stored (aka target dir). If relative, is relative to the current working directly when you execute ``wpxr-to-static``.

``download_content_images``: Whether to downloads images from the WordPress site into the target directory.

``image_origin_local_path``: If set, ``wpxr-to-static`` will look here first for an image file and only download the image if is not already present. Downloads are placed in this path.

``item_type_filter``: A YAML _list_ of item types (as defined later) to exclude from the output.

``rename_files``: A YAML _map_ of ``target-field-name: original-field-name`` pairs

``fields_value_replace``: A YAML _map_ of _maps_ that lists ``fields`` with maps of ``regexp-to-replace: regexp-substitution`` pairs.

#### Data Model Definition

TBD

### Execute

Run the script to convert your Wordpress XML file(s). 

**Note**: A configuration file and data model in the location specified in the config file are required to run the script.

#### Option 1: config.yaml in Current Directory

Linux:
```bash
/path/to/wpxr-to-static.py
```

Windows:
```
C:\path\to\wpxr-to-static.py
```

**Note** Instead of config.yaml, you can also use config.toml.
#### Option 2: config.yaml in another location

Linux:
```bash
/path/to/wpxr-to-static.py /another/path/to/config.yaml
```

Windows:
```
C:\path\to\wxpr-to-static.py C:\another\path\to\config.yaml
```

**Note**: You can substitute any ``name.yaml`` or ``name.toml`` for ``config.yaml``.

## Extras

``yaml2toml.py`` is a very simple YAML to TOML converter.
